## Financial Proposal Inputs

### 1. Cost Estimation

The RFP specifies various cost components that bidders need to consider:

*   **Software Costs:** Costs associated with the PIM software itself.
*   **Implementation Costs:** Costs for deploying and configuring the PIM solution.
*   **License Costs:** Costs for the necessary licenses required for the software and related components.

*   **FMS (Facility Management Support) Costs**: Costs associated with providing 24x7 onsite FMS support

Bidders are required to provide a detailed breakdown of these costs in the Bill of Material (BOM). The AMC costs should not be less than 12% of the underlying Solution.  FMS cost should have minimum 5% yearly increments factored. Bank will pay all applicable GST on software /hardware components.

### 2. Pricing Model

The pricing model is based on a combination of upfront costs and ongoing operational expenses:

*   **Capital Costs:**  One-time costs for software, implementation, licenses, and hardware.
*   **Recurring Costs:** Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) costs and quarterly operations costs.
*   The contract is extendable for one year at the same terms & conditions.

The commercial evaluation will be done through a reverse auction process among the technically qualified bidders. The contract will be awarded to the L1 bidder.

### 3. Revenue & Profitability Analysis

However, bidders are expected to factor in their own internal cost structures and profit margins when determining their pricing. The payment terms outlined in the RFP influence the bidder's cash flow and profitability.
