# Proposal for Procurement of Privilege Identity Management Solution and Facility Management Support (FMS)

## 1. Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive solution for Bank of India's requirement for a Privilege Identity Management (PIM) solution and Facility Management Support (FMS). Our solution addresses the bank's need for enhanced security, compliance with regulatory guidelines, and efficient management of privileged user access across its diverse IT infrastructure. We offer a robust, scalable, and reliable PIM solution with 24x7x365 onsite FMS support, ensuring seamless integration with existing systems and adherence to the highest security standards. This proposal details our solution's architecture, implementation plan, financial proposal, and legal terms and conditions, demonstrating our commitment to delivering a solution that meets and exceeds Bank of India's expectations.

## 2. Detailed Solution Description

Our proposed PIM solution offers a wide array of capabilities including:

*   **Privilege Access Management:** Securely manage and monitor privileged user access to critical IT assets.
*   **Session Recording and Monitoring:** Capture and audit privileged user sessions for enhanced security and compliance.
*   **Password Management:** Automate and secure the management of privileged account passwords.
*   **Workflow and Approval:** Implement multi-level approval workflows for privileged access requests.
*   **Integration with Existing Systems:** Seamlessly integrate with Bank of India's existing SIEM (QRADAR), DAM (Imperva), Vulnerability Management tool, AD/LDAP, and BMC Remedy ticketing solution.
*   **Compliance and Reporting:** Adhere to regulatory guidelines such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and RBI cybersecurity circulars, with comprehensive reporting capabilities.

The solution will be deployed in Bank of India's existing DC and DR sites, ensuring high availability and business continuity. Our experienced team will work closely with Bank of India's IT personnel to ensure a smooth implementation, seamless integration, and comprehensive training. OEM will be responsible for architecture design, migration and all technical support to maintain the required uptime through the vendor. OEM has to provide undertaking on company letter head that the architecture recommended is as per the OEM best practices and deployment plan. The bidder has to arrange for a Certificate from the OEM, certifying that the implementation has been done in line with the OEM best practices. The proposed PIM solution architecture should be able to consume existing PIM logs which enable the bank to view and analyze existing logs and videos. Migration efforts will be in the scope of the SI.
